Reel Life Fisherman is a one-player simulation game, where players experience the reality of fishing.

Reel Life Fisherman will have you hooked from the first catch. Take on the role of a fisherman, as you discover a variety of fish, row your boat to different spots and strategically catch as many fish as you can. With every fish you catch, you’ll become more skilled and make the perfect catch. So, get ready to cast your line and reel in the excitement! 

Steps for Playing:
Press “Enter” or click the Start Button to start the game.
Row left and right, using the left and right arrow keys or “A” and “D”.
To cast the line, the player can use the down arrow key or “S”.
To reel in the line, the player can use the up arrow key or “W”.
The hook cannot be reeled, until it reaches the bottom and the hook cannot be cast until it reaches back to the player.
Catch as many fish as you can.
